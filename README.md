The end goal of this method is to have CFOP-like length solutions in your Blind method execution, and you can have bigger thinkahead and hopefully reduce the mental effort of memo phase. It is not better than 3-style in any way, eventhough it is shorter in movecount.

Please check-out other advanced algsets like full floating 3-style, full parity, LTCT and LTEF. They are more relevant to you.

With bluetooth cubes, you can drill even more algorithms faster and in a random way.
