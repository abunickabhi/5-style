# 5style
5 Style is an extension to the very popular , efficient and finger-tricky 3x3 blindfolded method , 3 style.

To accelerate the learning rate of this mammoth near infinite, I have developed the Yo notation to memorize the algorithms:

I will be also documenting my progress on the fingertricks that I get for each case like in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkNI46No_xw

Since I am just starting out drilling, not all algs are sub-1ed by me, but I think they can be sub 1.5ed since most of the algs are no more than 14 moves.
Right now, I am 8000 algs down, and I need to memorize ~118000 algs more. Still lots of night hours to be burnt!


With the Giiker cube coming out last year, I can drill even more algorithms faster and randomly, and save time.

So, by my goal setting, by the end of 2020, I should have sub-1.5ed every 5-style edge alg and open sourced the fingertricks on my YT channel.
