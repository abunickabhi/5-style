# 5-Style : 3x3 Blindfold Advanced Method

![Image description](https://github.com/abunickabhi/5-style/blob/master/images/5style.jpg)

This doc will be discussing how you can intensely plan out your workflow in order to master 5-Style. With a method as daunting as this, you need a proper regime and workflow to sail all the way through. The fruits are enormous but so is the hard work and grind towards covering up and drilling all those 126,720 edge algs. The end result can be that you can expect CFOP length solutions in your Blind method execution, and you can have bigger grasping power while memorizing any worldly stuff.

Year 1:

Learn how to solve a Rubik’s Cube by Layer by Layer method. Learn the Blind method M2/OP, and understand commutators. Make a solid letter scheme.
Quick reminder:
If you have not seen the doc on the introduction to 5-Style do check it out here:

Year 2:

Learn Orozco and 3-Style Method (UF/UFR). Practice Mnenomics and Memory techniques. 
An example site is: https://bestsiteever.ru/memotest/
Topics to be covered are, Memory Palace and Loci Method

Year 3:

Learn about 20,000 Letter Quads and do a lot of MBLD attempts to encounter a lot of cube states. There are about a quarter million letter quads possible. The younger you are, the faster you will be able to adopt this system

Year 4:

From my 5-Style alg sheet master 60,000 edge algorithms. Understand the Yo notation to implement and memorize all the 5-Style edge algs 

Year 5:

Drill all the 5-Style algs and make them sub-1 using the Giiker cube. Invent new fingertricks if required. I have made a whole video channel “5-Style Repertoire” for troubleshooting all the problems that can be faced at this stage.

To accelerate the learning rate of this mammoth and near infinite alg-set, I have developed the Yo notation to memorize the algorithms.
Documentation of Yo notation:

I will be also documenting my progress on the fingertricks like in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkNI46No_xw

Since I am just starting out drilling, not all algs are sub-1ed by me, but I think they can be sub 1.5ed since most of the algs are no more than 12 moves STM. Right now, I am 8000 algs down in UF and DF, and I need to memorize ~118000 algs more. Still lots of night hours and computer time to be burnt!

With the Giiker cube coming out last year, you can drill even more algorithms faster and randomly, thus saving valuable save time.

So, by my calculations, by the end of 2020, I should have sub-1.5ed every 5-style edge alg and open sourced the fingertricks on this YT channel.
