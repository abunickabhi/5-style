# Letter Quads

Groups of 4 letters or two letter pairs implying just one image. This list would make memorization have lesser images and become faster. The fluidity and familiarity of the images is quite less at first due to the vast number of cases.

Note: UF5 and letter quads are independent endeavors. The only thing common is the number of cases there are for edges and wings and corners.

The end goal of this method is to have CFOP-like length solutions in your Blind method execution, and you can have bigger thinkahead and hopefully reduce the mental effort of memo phase. It is not better than 3-style in any way, eventhough it is shorter in movecount. The algset is called irritating as it is big and overwhelming. It requires smart work to even get a subset of this algset in.

Please check-out other advanced algsets like full floating 3-style, full parity, LTCT and LTEF first before skimming over UF5 cases.

Note: If you are beginning with blindsolving, first learn the Orozco method and then the 3-Style Method (UF/UFR)
