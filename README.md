The end goal of this method is to have CFOP-like length solutions in your Blind method execution, and you can have bigger thinkahead and hopefully reduce the mental effort of memo phase. 

If you are seeing this method for the first time, the plan below is a ballpark estimate for how long it will take to understand and get functional / proficient with this method. Potentially it will be a speedup and be an add-on to advanced 3-style (full floating 3-style, full parity, LTCT and LTEF).

# Step 1

Learn how to solve a Rubik’s Cube by Layer by Layer method. Learn the Blind method M2/OP, and understand commutators. Make a solid letter scheme.

# Step 2

Learn Orozco and 3-Style Method (UF/UFR). Practice Mnenomics and Memory techniques. 
An example site is: https://bestsiteever.ru/memotest/
Topics to be covered are, Memory Palace and Loci Method

# Step 3

Learn 20,000 Letter Quads (in PAO format) and do a lot of MBLD attempts to encounter a lot of cube states. There are about a quarter million letter quads possible. The younger you are, the faster you will be able to adopt this system.

# Step 4

Refer to 5-Style alg sheet with over 60,000 edge algorithms. Understand the Yo notation to implement and memorize all the 5-Style edge algs 

# Step 5

Drill all the 5-Style algs and make them sub-1 using the Giiker cube. Invent new fingertricks if required. I have made a whole video channel “5-Style Repertoire” for troubleshooting all the problems that can be faced at this stage.

With bluetooth cubes, you can drill even more algorithms faster and in a random way.
